      "description": "I'm Efaz Ibrahim, a passionate Software Engineer and Computer Science student at the University of South Florida, graduating in December 2025. I thrive at the intersection of backend systems, cloud technologies, and intuitive user interfaces, building solutions that are both scalable and impactful. I've gained hands-on experience through internships at Wells Fargo and USAA, where I built full-stack applications with innovative front ends and robust backends, integrated real-time dashboards, optimized deployment pipelines, and developed reusable UI components used enterprise-wide. My work has spanned Spring Boot, MongoDB, AWS, GCP, React, and Node.js, with a strong emphasis on performance optimization, automation, and clean architecture.\n\nBeyond my professional experience, I enjoy taking on challenging projects, from creating an AI-powered trip planning tool to developing a cross-platform workout tracking app. I'm driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and the satisfaction of turning ideas into realityâ€”whether through enterprise solutions or innovative side projects.\n\nWhen I'm not coding, I'm a regular at the gym, play a variety of sports, and enjoy traveling to explore new places and cultures.",
